        Energy coordination and baseline level of access to electricity is a human right ‚ö°Ô∏èüá∫üá≥

        <ul>
          <li><b>capital efficiency</b> - as a microgrid powered by solar ‚òÄÔ∏è  - can I go to the market and be sure that I am optimally allocating every $ </li>
          <li><b>value alignment</b> - not violating ethical standards of microgrid users while still coordinating in the grid</li>
          <li><b>resilience</b> - in an event of a transmission failure - climate, war, political upheaval - the grid of grids needs to rapidly reconfigure itself or risk an outage</li>
          <li><b>fraud prevention</b> - shift the enforcement of agreed upon energy distribution rules from human intermediaries / operators to math and code under certain well-understood corruptibility barriers</li>
